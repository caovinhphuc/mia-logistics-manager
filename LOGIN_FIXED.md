**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## 🐛 Problem

The `googleAuthService.login()` method was empty and returning `null`, causing:
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Added mock users and login logic to `src/services/googleAuthService.js`:

### Mock Users Added
- Admin: `admin@mialogistics.com` / `admin123`
- Manager: `manager@mialogistics.com` / `manager123`
- Operator: `operator@mialogistics.com` / `operator123`
- Driver: `driver@mialogistics.com` / `driver123`

### Login Logic
```javascript
async login(email, password) {
  // Check if user exists in mock data
  // Verify password
  // Return user object with all required fields
}
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try login** again with credentials
3. Should work now!

---

## ✅ What Should Happen

1. Enter credentials
2. Click Sign In
3. Session created successfully
4. Redirected to dashboard
5. No more errors!

**Login is now fixed!** 🎉
